## Conclusion

In fact, there are numerous disciplines involved in Quantum Computing, with great scope for exploration,
business opportunities and study. In this context, we have seen that classical cryptography must evolve
into a new post-quantum scenario, able to cope with new processing power that will be made available
to individuals and companies as soon as the first quantum computers become more commercial.
The journey that began in the 1990s with the discovery of Shor's algorithm is not only beginning,
it is accelerating!
