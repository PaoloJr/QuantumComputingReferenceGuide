    "## 3.2 Silicon quantum dots\n",

    "A quantum dot is a way to trap a single electron in a controllable manner. It is achieved by confining\n",
    "electrons in the 0th dimension (0D). The following shows possible dimensionalities electrons can occupy.\n",
    "A 0D scenario is not easily found in natural materials but we can create an artificial trap in a semiconductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure dimensions](image/dimensions.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "_These graphics are a simplification that describes dimensionalities for electrons to occupy. In an actual\n",
    "material, there are also nuclei inside atoms and defects in the crystal lattices, but we are only drawing\n",
    "the presence of electrons._\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a quantum dot, we can start from 2D. Electrons can be confined into a plane at the\n",
    "interface between two semiconducting materials grown in laboratories and fabrication facilities, because\n",
    "they are not natural. Such an electron plane is called a 2D electron gas (2DEG).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 2DEG](image/2DEG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "_AlGaAs and GaAs are examples of two commonly used semiconductors for making a 2DEG. The search\n",
    "for the best materials for quantum dot quantum computing is an ongoing effort._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can deposit some metal structures above the 2DEG. By applying appropriate voltages to\n",
    "the metals, electrons underneath can be removed. This process is called \"depletion\". We can create all\n",
    "kinds of shapes for the metals, forming little islands in the 2DEG where electrons can be depleted one by\n",
    "one until only one electron is left in an island.\n",

    "This is our electron trap. The electron acts as a qubit whose spin defines its state. It can be\n",
    "manipulated with magnetic or electric fields applied from the electrodes. To have multiple qubits, several\n",
    "traps can be created next to one another. The magnetic dipole interaction between nearby electrons\n",
    "allows them to couple and entangle.\n",

    ">Quantum dots are one of the \"artificial atoms\" we can engineer. A natural atom has a\n",
    ">nucleus bounding electrons to their orbits. Mimicking the bounding of electrons,\n",
    ">quantum dots behave like atoms.\n",
    ">Some of the methods of producing qubits in the following sessions, such as\n",
    ">making crystal defects and superconducting circuits, can also be considered as creating\n",
    ">\"artificial atoms\". A defect in a crystal lattice can act like a nucleus trapping an electron\n",
    ">introduced by a foreign atom. A superconducting circuit has energy levels reminiscent\n",
    ">of the energy levels of electrons inside an atom, even though the circuit does not have\n",
    ">direct analogies of electrons and nucleus.\n",
    ">In fact, we can find many systems in the universe behaving in similar ways, by\n",
    ">looking at their mathematical descriptions. For example, comparing the energy\n",
    ">equations of an oscillating circuit and a pendulum and the Schrödinger equation of a\n",
    ">hydrogen atom, the equations have the same form and we can see parameters that\n",
    ">appear at the same locations of these equations. They are counterparts in\n",
    ">electromagnetism, mechanics and quantum mechanics. Thus, by grasping the\n",
    ">similarities, we can make an electromagnetic pendulum or a qubit in a solid-state\n",
