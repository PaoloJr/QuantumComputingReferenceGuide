    "## 3.6 Topological qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from other types of qubit systems, which rely on single electrons or single atoms (either natural\n",
    "or artificial), a topological qubit is formed based on collective interactions of many electrons. Here's how\n",
    "it can be set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically hypothesized by Ettore Majorana in 1937, the existence of an electron can be\n",
    "mathematically described by a pair of symbols representing a real part and an imaginary part. Each part\n",
    "is sometimes called a Majorana quasiparticle. They couple together as a pair to form an electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](image/Majorana_pairs_0.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "Electrons can be put in a row. This is practically achieved by using a semiconductor nanowire,\n",
    "where electrons are confined in one-dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](image/Majorana_pairs_1.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "The nanowire can be brought close to a superconductor. When this happens, the electromagnetic\n",
    "field from the superconductor can affect the pairing of Majorana quasiparticles, exchanging their partners\n",
    "with the adjacent electrons. This leaves the Majorana quasiparticles at each end of the nanowire alone.\n",
    "These at the ends have a special name called \"Majorana zero modes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](image/Majorana_pairs_2.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine the electrons can be emptied out from the nanowires. Where the Majorana\n",
    "quasiparticles were, indicates the locations that are possible for electrons to occupy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](image/topological_qubit_0.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "When some electrons are let into the nanowire, they will go to those locations and their Majorana\n",
    "quasiparticles will pair with their neighbors. With the same number of electrons inside the nanowire,\n",
    "there are two possible outcomes: the Majorana zero modes could be empty or occupied. These two\n",
    "situations are respectively defined as the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](image/topological_qubit_1.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the entire system is used to define a qubit. Inside the nanowire, there can be any number of\n",
    "electrons and it does not matter where they are. States |0⟩ and |1⟩ have the exact same number of\n",
    "electrons in the nanowire except at the ends – they differ by only one electron. It takes a whole electron\n",
    "to occupy the two Majorana zero modes. This difference of one electron can affect properties of the\n",
    "nanowire, such as its conductance. These are global properties of the nanowire. Thus, by measuring a\n",
    "global parameter defined by the total number of electrons of the nanowire, one could tell which state the\n",
    "qubit is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](image/conductance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To help enhance your understanding, let's use a metaphor to describe the system. Imagine the\n",
    "nanowire is like a train and the superconductor next to it is like a train track. Inside the train, the\n",
    "passengers come in pairs. All the seats are doubles. They can sit wherever they want, with their original\n",
    "partners or exchange partners but they cannot sit alone. The train can have any even number of\n",
    "passengers. It can run whether or not all passenger seats are occupied. The key is to have drivers. This\n",
    "train has two driver seats, one on each end. It takes both driver seats to be occupied to operate. If the\n",
    "driver seats on both ends are occupied, the train can run on the track in either direction. This is like\n",
    "electricity can run in the nanowire, giving a conductance reading. If the driver seats are empty, the train\n",
    "stays stationary. No conductivity can be observed. Looking at conductance to see if the Majorana zero\n",
    "modes are occupied is like figuring out whether a train can run based on the presence or absence of its\n",
    "drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](image/train.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement is not sensitive to the exact positions of the electrons. It only depends on if the\n",
    "ends of the nanowire are occupied by the Majorana quasiparticle pair or not. This is the reason why it is\n",
    "called a topological qubit – _local_ information about individual electrons is not needed; only _global_\n",
    "parameters about the entire system are used. Therefore, a topological qubit is protected from noise\n",
    "brought in from the environment that makes _local_ perturbation to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "![text](image/topology.png)\n",
    "_An often-used analogy: a teacup and a donut have the same topology. Locally we cannot distinguish them._\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a much-simplified introduction to topological qubits. The actual architecture of a\n",
    "topological quantum computer is complex and evolving.\n",

    ">The concepts in this section require advanced graduate-level physics and mathematics,\n",
    ">which is beyond the general audience of this tutorial. We translate them into\n",
    ">illustrations instead.\n",

    ">The field of condensed matter physics, differing from astrophysics and particle\n",
    ">physics, is one that studies fundamental properties of materials. As materials are\n",
    ">formed by atoms, which consist of electrons and nuclei, we need to deal with\n",
    ">interactions between many of these microscopic particles. We have seen in the\n",
    ">previous inserts about conductors and superconductors, free electrons move in an ion\n",
    ">lattice to conduct electricity. Throughout their journey, they constantly bump into the\n",
    ">ions, attracted to the positively charged nuclei, repelled by other negatively charged\n",
    ">electrons, etc. All these happening together makes it very complicated dynamics to\n",
    ">handle. However, we can consider the overall experience of an electron. Its existence\n",
    ">is affecting all particles surrounding it. Its motion is carrying the effects with it as it\n",
    ">moves along. With all the collective interactions, it can approximately be described as\n",
    ">an unperturbed particle travelling in free space with an effective mass differing from\n",
    ">its original electron mass. An analogy would be a room full of people with some VIPs\n",
    ">entering. Everyone gathers around the VIPs and moves along with them. Effectively the\n",
    ">overall mass of everyone moves correlating to the VIPs. Equivalently, we can say a VIP\n",
    ">moves with an effective mass. Such a VIP electron and its effects placed on the entire\n",
    ">system is described as a \"quasiparticle\" or \"collective excitation\".\n",

    ">Let's introduce a few terms before we go further:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Fermion** (named after Enrico Fermi): a particle with spins that are integer\n",
    ">multiples of 1/2. Fermions with the same spin cannot occupy the same energy level due\n",
    ">to Pauli exclusion principle, following Fermi-Dirac statistics. For example, an electron is\n",
    ">a fermion as it has spin 1/2. Each energy level can accommodate a maximum of two\n",
    ">electrons with opposite spins.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Boson** (named after Satyendra Nath Bose): a particle with integer spin. For\n",
    ">example, a photon with spin 0 is a boson. Bosons can occupy the same energy level,\n",
    ">following Bose-Einstein statistics.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Anyon** (named after Jean Anyon): a quasiparticle that is neither a fermion nor\n",
    ">a boson. They only appear in one- or two-dimensional systems. They follow the\n",
    ">braiding statistics (see later).\n",

    ">In 1937, Ettore Majorana theoretically suggested that a neutral spin 1/2 particle\n",
    ">can be its own antiparticle. They are called Majorana fermions, in contrast to Dirac\n",
    ">fermions which are not their own antiparticles. Majorana fermions can appear as\n",
    ">quasiparticle excitations and have zero charge. They can emerge in superconducting\n",
    ">materials due to electron-hole symmetry, enabling the quasiparticle excitations to be\n",
    ">their own antiparticles. As N. Read and Dmitry Green in 2008 theoretically proved, we\n",
    ">can use a 2-dimentional superconductor to physically realize this mathematical\n",
    ">construct in actual materials. It requires a broken time-reversal symmetry, and a p-\n",
    ">wave superconductor. If the superconductors have defects, then the Majorana\n",
    ">fermions can bound to the defects, forming Majorana zero modes. The Majorana zero\n",
    ">modes are no longer fermions. The statistics they obey is that of non-abelian anyons.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">_Physics insert – non-abelian anyons_ ------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    ">\n",
    ">There are two kinds of anyons, abelian and non-abelian. The terminology comes from\n",
    ">group theory, in which an abelian group obeys commutative operations. This means\n",
    ">that when applying a group operation to two group elements in an abelian group, the\n",
    ">result does not depend on the order in which the elements are written. Interchanging\n",
    ">two elements is effectively adding an overall phase (can be complex) to the state, which\n",
    ">does not have a measurable effect. A non-abelian group, however, does depend on the\n",
    ">order of elements. An operation on a non-abelian group needs to be a unitary matrix.\n",
    ">Remember our quantum gates are unitary matrices. Interchanging two non-a belian\n",
    ">anyons is equivalent to applying a quantum gate to the state.\n",

    ">![text](image/abelian.png)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">P-wave superconductors are hard to find in nature. Effectively we need to\n",
    ">construct it using commonly found s-wave superconductors and at the interface\n",
    ">between them and other materials, there can be Majorana zero modes. Examples of\n",
    ">the other materials include topological insulators, spin-orbit coupled semiconductors,\n",
    ">a chain of magnetic atoms or half-metals. Alaxei Yu. Kitaev in 2000 proposed that\n",
    ">nanowires can be made from these materials and be placed in proximity to a\n",

    ">The ends of the nanowires bind Majorana zero modes. The nanowires\n",
    ">mentioned in the main sections are made this way. This combination of materials is\n",
    ">called a topological nanowire heterostructure, which is the architecture for quantum\n",
    ">computing adopted by industry so far. \n",

    ">In such a nanowire heterostructure, electrons in the nanowire form a chain. Each\n",
    ">electron possesses two Majorana fermions which can be paired differently. One\n",
    ">configuration has no unpaired Majorana fermions at the ends, therefore no Majorana\n",
    ">zero modes (trivial phase), whereas the other configuration has (topological phase).\n",
    ">We can practically switch between the two configurations by adjusting the chemical\n",
    ">potential in the nanowire. The Hamiltonian of the system has a chemical potential term\n",
    ">and a kinetic term. When the chemical potential term dominates, the system is in the\n",

    ">Gate operations on the topological qubits are through braiding. To form\n",
    ">Majorana zero modes, we need at least four Majorana fermions, thus two electrons.\n",
    ">But to braid the zero modes, we need at least three pairs of them, thus three electrons.\n",
    ">Physically we can apply bias voltages onto the nanowires to change chemical potentials\n",

    ">As we have discussed, topological quantum computing does not rely on the local\n",
    ">properties of the system. As we are looking at the collective behavior of multiple\n",
    ">anyons, in our case Majorana zero modes, we use a process called anyon fusion to\n",

    ">We've seen an example of the last fusion rule in the nanowires in the main text.\n",
    ">An electron, which is a fermion, can be described by two anyons. The two anyon states\n",
    ">can be occupied to make an electron or unoccupied to make a vacuum.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">With the fusion rules established, we can represent qubits with anyons. Consider\n",
    ">a two-qubit system. It needs six anyons, which can fuse into two fermions or at most\n",

    ">Apart from providing the physical realization of the mathematical construct of a\n",
    ">topological quantum state, superconductors in the system provide another purpose –\n",
    ">to protect the topological states from being destroyed by the environmental\n",
    ">perturbations. The formation of Cooper pairs in a superconductor makes two electrons\n",
    ">(fermions) into bosons. Thus, all Copper pairs can lie on a ground state. It takes a certain\n",
    ">amount of energy to transition a material from its superconducting state to a normal\n",
    ">conductor. Hence, there is an energy gap Δ in superconducting materials. Within this\n",
    ">gap, our constructed system is protected because it needs more than Δ to break the\n",
    ">Cooper pairs and destroy our qubit setup. The energy gap suppresses thermal fluctuations at least as \n",
    ">\n",
    ">$e^\\frac{\\delta}{2k_BT}$\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The value of Δ scales with the superconductor's critical\n",
    ">temperature, $T_C$.  At absolute zero, Δ(T = 0 K)= 1. 764 $k_B T_C$. The critical temperature\n",
    ">is a material property of the superconductor, therefore so is Δ. To keep the\n",
    ">superconductor at its superconducting state, we need to cool it down below $T_C$. It has\n",
    ">been a holy grail in condensed matter physics to find high-$T_C$ superconductors. This will\n",
    ">also help us find superconductors with larger energy gap Δ, making the topological\n",
    ">qubits more robust to temperature fluctuations.\n",
